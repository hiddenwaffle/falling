## About

Lighting was written for GitHub's [Game Off 2016] (https://gameoff.github.com/), where the theme was to write a game loosely based on "hacking, modding, and/or augmenting".

A popular real-life hack is the repurposing of office building lights to simulate low resolution displays. This game is a tribute to two events that showcased this type of hack:

* **Building Design** - Green Building, MIT, 2012
* **Gameplay Design** - Cira Centre, Philadelpha, 2014
