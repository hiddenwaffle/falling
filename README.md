## About

Falling was written for GitHub's [Game Off 2016] (https://gameoff.github.com/). The theme was to write a game loosely based on the theme of "hacking, modding, and/or augmenting".

One of my favorite real-life hacks is the repurposing of skyscraper lighting to simulate low resolution displays. Falling is a tribute to two events that showcased this type of hack:
* **Building Design** - Green Building, MIT, 2012
* **Gameplay Design** - Cira Center, Philadelpha, 2014
